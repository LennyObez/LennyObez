# 👋 Hi, I’m Lenny Obez

Full-stack developer from **Huy, Belgium** (PHP/JS/SQL).  
I build secure, maintainable web systems - and I’m currently building **Pulsar** (WIP): a modular PHP framework designed for real-world apps and long-running runtimes.

---

## 🔭 What I’m working on

### ⚡ Pulsar (WIP)
Repo: https://github.com/LennyObez/pulsar-framework

Pulsar is built around **first-party extensions**, strong contracts, and **audit-friendly architecture**.  
It’s designed for production concerns like **deterministic boot/dependency resolution**, **worker safety**, and **observability that won’t blow up cardinality**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech stack

- **Languages:** PHP, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS, SQL  
- **Frameworks / UI:** Symfony, Bootstrap (and custom tooling/framework work)  
- **Tooling:** Git, GitHub, GitLab, Docker, CI/CD, tests + static analysis  
- **Data:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite (and Redis when needed)  
- **Cloud:** AWS, OVHcloud, Google Cloud  
- **CMS / e-commerce:** WordPress, Drupal, PrestaShop, HubSpot  

---

## ✨ Highlights

- 🏆 Built **custom e-commerce platforms** and integrations for growing businesses  
- ✨ Integrated **AI-assisted workflows** to speed up planning, refactors, tests, and docs (with human review)  
- 🎯 Modernized legacy stacks into **clean, testable architectures** with a security + performance focus  
- 🗳️ Worked on **mission-critical digital infrastructure** (including election-related tooling)

## 🤖 AI tools I use (responsibly)

- ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini  
- GitHub Copilot (IDE + PRs)

My rule: AI helps me move faster - but I still benchmark, review, and own the final result.

## 📷 Outside of code

Explorer + photographer - mostly night, urban, and “mission vibe” shoots.
