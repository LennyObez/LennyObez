# Lenny Obez

Full-stack PHP developer based in Huy, Belgium. Founder of Lenny Obez Ind.

I build secure, maintainable software for real-world use — from frameworks
to end-user applications and professional websites.

## AI-Assisted Development

I integrate AI tools into my development workflow to accelerate planning,
implementation, testing, and documentation. Tools I use include Claude,
ChatGPT, Gemini, and GitHub Copilot.

Every output is reviewed, tested, and validated before integration. AI
enhances velocity — it does not replace engineering judgment.

## Explorer & Photographer

Outside of code, I explore landscapes and urban environments with a camera.
Night photography, urban scenes, and fieldwork. Content shared across
platforms.
